Hi user,
When you start the game, you'll need to register and log in.
after that, set your game keys and other settings, or press the "Random" button for automatic values- and hit the "Save" button.
Wait for the starting music to end and start playing.
Enjoy :)

Extras we added to the game:
- "medicine" of extra life- appears when 1 life left (pacman image)
- a clock "food" that, on taking, gives extra time (quarter of original time)- appears when entering last quarter of the original time (hourglass image) 


This game designed and coded by Nadav Chapnick and Ziv Gura, during our studies for B.Sc in Information Systems at Ben-Gurion University, back in 2020.
